### Setting up the game
Here are the steps to start your very own Capture the Flag Wargame:
1. Boot up your terminal and navigate to a file which you want to clone the file into
2. Clone the following git repository into your computer using terminal through the command ``https://github.com/ngzhaoming/Capture-the-Flag-Wargame.git``
2. Once the repository has been cloned, you should have the necessary zip files to start on your wargame mission to capture the flag.

I wish you all the best in your mission and may the best coder wins! ðŸ˜„

### Getting started with the first puzzle
Here is the clue to the first puzzle. Every sentence here plays a part to form the first password. Look and pay close attention to the first word of each sentence. Letters are what you want to focus on. Only those who aim for the first will succeed! Will help if you enter the password in lower-case. Once you figure out the password, open up the `zip` file and type it in. Remember to play this game cautiously due to potential dangerous exec files. Let me know should there be any issues or bug during the course of the game. Don't forget to have fun while playing the game!
