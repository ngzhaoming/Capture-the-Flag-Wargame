If you have made it this far to read this, then I'm impressed! Those were some very challenging discrete mathematics and arithmatic problems. Nonetheless, I congratulate you for coming this far.

Your next challenge will involve some knowledge of bases and Googling skills. I will present you with a String containing clues. The password to the next stage involves the unicode of an emoji. (Example: U+1F602) I'm sure that with the help of software available in the internet, this will be a walk in the park. But rest assured, this is only the beginning of the encryption challenges.

Here is the string containing the clue for this challenge:

Njg3NDc0NzA3M
zNhMmYyZjY1Nm
Q2ZjZhNjk3MDY
1NjQ2OTYxMmU2
ZjcyNjcyZjY2N
zU2YzZjMmQ2ZD
ZmNmY2ZTJkNjY
2MTYzNjUyZg==

p.s. Notice that there is an addition folder named "side quest" located during this trial. These side quests appear occasionally during your journey. These side quests also contains challenging puzzles but they do yield good rewards upon completion! So you are encourage to try them out.
To unlock the side quest, use the same password that is meant of the next challenge.
