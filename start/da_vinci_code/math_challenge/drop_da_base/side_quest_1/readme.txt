Greetings traveller! Thank you for attempting this first side quest in your mission to Capture the Flag. As you can see I'm a rather old and raggedy wizard in need of help. You see, I seemed to have forgotten the password to my house lock.

Luckily, I have written some clues to my house lock in case I forget it someday. Seems like it will be put to good use now!

But before I give you the files to solve this side quest, I have a question for you, do you know what is my name on Telegram? Trying searching for me on Telegram by using "@<My name>", boot me up before requesting the files containing the clues through the request "/ctfSideQuest".

Since I'm a nice wizard, I will give you a hint, "My name can be found on one of the creator's Github Repository! Yes, I was made by him! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
