Woah it's quite amazing that you have toiled through so much already! Remember to take some breaks if you are tired. You can always come back again once you are ready to take on more challenges. I might have even lost count on how many puzzles you have completed already (judging on which path you have taken).

Nonetheless, the next trial is going to be an interesting one! The password for the next trial is inspired based on the RSA calculation assignment that I have did once. Yes! The infamous RSA calculation but the twist is the prime number c that I'm about to give you have been broken before! The all powerful Google will be able to direct you to a site which gives you the broken p and q values. Read up on how RSA works and try this out for yourself! :)

Here are some numbers that you can work with to code out the password for the next section!
c =                                                                                                  4817311251953964954683741959994023230807956934322571042008447406842365927003964136010900085948470710898215762285707611363240582119229476104939650721699381704941123364811344724592982701830794079598394285146498150830862454334000971277684695435401757578174165958727166015623660193224743868743169794663297551924216693509773157908427355054043577132853500792288268541065995860229716371030156790687127058407753253575399258162145001628070304720512848770014571941910312263708361162921750599521331459106541810986898798211369316535638334255897783293174222672342746614648479227657510647272385373546061481897631235779201853642340

Hints: 
Find the 2 prime p,q.

There are online database with broken N. 
A simple search will do.
