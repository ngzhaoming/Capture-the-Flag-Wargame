Nice! You got pass Number facts. Seems like you are pretty proficient in searching out factorials of large prime numbers. Next up I'm going to introduce to you an interesting term known as the Mandela Effect. Not heard of it before? It is basically a false memory phenomenon where a person recalls something that did not happen or recall it differently from the way it actually happened.

Here's a quick and well-known example:
In Snow White and the seven dwarfs, the evil witch always like to ask the magic mirror she own:

Mirror, Mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?

However, this was not the actual phrase that was being said in the original version of the classical fairy tale. Instead the actual sentence was:

Magic Mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?

There are many explanation for such occurrences, common ones being suggestibility, activation of associated information, the incorporation of misinformation and source misattribution. This trial includes a quiz to see whether you have living your life as a lie. There are only 3 questions contained in this quiz. However, be warned that a fork bomb might await one should mistakes are made. Good luck and all the best in this trial!
