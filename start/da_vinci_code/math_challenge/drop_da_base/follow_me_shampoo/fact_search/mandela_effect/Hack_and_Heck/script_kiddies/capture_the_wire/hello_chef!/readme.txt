Disclaimer: This stage is an exact question that I took from my Cyber Security module assignment. I thought it's a rather fun exercise that focuses on AES-ECB and will prove as a good stage for this next puzzle.

Your main goal in this challenge is to open the text file, tasty_flag_recipe.txt. Just a note, the link is intentionally made to be broken. Hence, your mission here is to circumvent this broken link and still "open" up the link to this text file. Once that you have gotten the flag, use the flag as the key for the next stage!

Fun fact: The "recipe" given in both classic_souffle.txt and awesome_chocolate_cake.txt are written in chef language. This is a language that programmers use to try and create code that are compilable and also ensure that it can be used as a recipe to make yummy food! By using an online chef interpreter, you will realise that both those code will compile into "hello world", which is why the title is named that way. Although honestly, I felt that the "recipe" generated from both recipe looks like it's How To Basic making the dish.
