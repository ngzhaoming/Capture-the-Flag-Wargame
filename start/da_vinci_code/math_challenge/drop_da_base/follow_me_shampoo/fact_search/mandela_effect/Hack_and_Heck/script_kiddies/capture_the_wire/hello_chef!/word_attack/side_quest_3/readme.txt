Welcome to the next stage of Github Capture the Flag. Before we start, may I give a friendly reminder to try out the side quest for more experience and helpful tools to assist you with your quest. The old wizard definitely needs your help in remembering his key!

Nonetheless, let us begin with the next trial. In this stage, you are presented with me the All Knowing Oracle, Itanimulli. I hold the key to the next stage but I won't give it up that easily. You will have to question me for the key. Give me a binary string and I will reply you with the answer.

Look up on how to use NOR operation and you will succeed in this trial!
