Welcome to the next stage of Github Capture the Flag. Before we start, may I give a friendly reminder to try out the side quest for more experience and helpful tools to assist you with your quest.

Nonetheless, thank you for trying this next side quest. In this stage, you are presented with me the All Knowing Oracle, Itanimulli. I hold the key to the next stage but I won't give it up that easily. You will have to question me for the key. Give me a binary string and I will reply you with the answer.

Look up on how to use NOR operation and you will succeed in this trial! But before you start, you can see that you are given two jar files, hello.jar and nor.jar. I shall assist you young Padawan on how to open and access the information inside this jar files.

Firstly, you need to ensure that you have installed the Java JDK environment that is being stated during the README. Once you have that installed and settled, you can proceed to going into your terminal and type in this command:

java -cp ./hello.jar hello

This will run the hello.jar file. The jar file will compile and execute giving you the output "Hello World". Once you successfully open the jar file, you are ready to open up the nor.jar file and start your challenge for this side quest using the following command:

java -cp ./nor.jar nor

Me the All Knowing Oracle, Itanimulli will be your guide for this stage, solve me and you will be rewarded for the key I'm going to use is going to be the key to unlock the encrypted file provided in this stage.
