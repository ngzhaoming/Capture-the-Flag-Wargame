I must say that I'm very impressed with your progress. Your dedication, knowledge and courage has led you this far! Now, the next puzzle that I'm going to present to you might be a toughie. There is not much hint that is being given to obtain this key other than the key is a 10 letter word consisting of only lower case letters from a DICTIONARY. Yes, it's just a simple dictionary attack, but requires you to have a reliant software to try and solve this. This word should be very familiar to all of us and I'm very optimistic that you will be able to crack the password in no time.

Other than that, there shouldn't be other hints that I can provide for this stage. So go ahead and try out this dictionary attack with a word consisting of 10 letters. I wish you all the best and hopefully it doesn't takes up too much on your time solving this puzzle.
