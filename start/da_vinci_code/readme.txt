In olden days, people tend to use substitution cipher to encrypt their messages so that their information can maintain confidentiality even if it is intercepted by others. However, the main weakness of substitution cipher is how easy it can be easily broken. With known plaintext attack, it is very easy to crack any encrypted messages.

To add precautionary measure, the password to the next stage is safely encrypted in pixel.png. To add further precautionary measure, the picture is in turn encrypted with a key. To add another layer of precautionary measure, the key is in turn encrypted using substitution cipher! However, wee have managed to get hold of the encrypted key for you. Help us derive the password to the next stage!

We have also acquired some pangram which are encrypted using the substitution cipher. Interesting fact: Pangram is a sentence or expression that uses all the letters of the alphabets! This will be useful to determine the symmetric key that is being used to encrypt the key to the picture.
