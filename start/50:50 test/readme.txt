Great job! One way or another, you seemed to have passed the second trial! Hopefully you should be getting a hang on how this game works now. Let's warmup with some mathematical problems, including basic arithmetic calculations to mind boggling discrete mathematics. There are a total of 3 T/F questions and 3 MCQ question. Get all correct and I will see you at the next trial. Once you are ready, start up murderous_math exec file to answer those questions. Good luck!
